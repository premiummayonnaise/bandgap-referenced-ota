# bandgap-referenced-ota
A proposed design for the participation in UNIC-CASS 3rd edition 2025
# Welcome to our team's repository!
Here, we are proposing a temperature and corners robust bandgap-referenced OTA. This work is based on our team's previous work in design in low-power two stage miller OTA with a gain of 70 dB, PSRR of 70 dB, and a phase margin above 60 degrees.
